While your updated code is much improved, there are still areas where you can enhance it further:

1. Validate Data Integrity
Issue:

The code assumes that bid and ask prices are always available and valid in the data.
Suggestion:

Data Checks: Before using row['bid'] or row['ask'], ensure they are not only non-null but also positive numbers.
Handle Invalid Data: If prices are zero or negative, consider them invalid and handle accordingly.
2. Consider Market Depth and Order Sizes
Issue:

The profit calculations assume infinite liquidity at the best bid and ask prices.
Suggestion:

Volume Data: Incorporate available volume data to ensure the arbitrage opportunity is practical for the desired trade size.
Slippage and Impact: Acknowledge that large trades may affect market prices, potentially reducing profit.
3. Fee Structure Enhancements
Issue:

Transaction fees are applied uniformly, but fees can vary by trading pair or transaction type (maker vs. taker fees).
Suggestion:

Detailed Fee Configuration: Allow fees to be specified per exchange, per trading pair, or per action (buy/sell).
Fee Types: Differentiate between maker and taker fees if such data is available.
4. Improve the _find_valid_triangles Method
Issue:

The current method may not find all valid triangular paths, especially in markets with more complex trading pairs.
Suggestion:

Dynamic Path Finding: Generalize the method to work with any set of trading pairs, possibly using graph algorithms to find cycles.
Support for Arbitrary Currencies: Allow the code to handle currencies beyond those specified in self.trading_pairs.
5. Optimize Performance
Issue:

The nested loops in _find_valid_triangles can become inefficient as the number of trading pairs increases.
Suggestion:

Use Efficient Data Structures: Convert the list of trading pairs into a graph or dictionary for faster lookups.
Limit Paths: Implement mechanisms to avoid redundant path calculations.
6. Enhance Logging and Output
Issue:

The display_opportunities method logs information but doesn't provide options for output formats.
Suggestion:

Flexible Output: Allow the method to output results to different formats (e.g., console, file, or return as data).
Logging Levels: Adjust logging levels to separate informational messages from warnings and errors.
7. Add Docstrings and Comments
Issue:

Some methods lack docstrings or explanatory comments.
Suggestion:

Document Methods: Add docstrings to each method explaining its purpose, parameters, and return values.
Inline Comments: Include comments within complex code blocks to explain non-obvious logic.
8. Include Unit Tests
Issue:

There are no tests to verify that each method works as intended.
Suggestion:

Write Tests: Implement unit tests for key methods using a testing framework like unittest or pytest.
Test Cases: Include tests for typical cases, edge cases, and error handling scenarios.
